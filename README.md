# GameOfLife2D

## Conway’s Game of Life rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.

2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.

3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

Delivery: Unity project not including file generated by Unity Editor (Library, obj, etc…)

### MVP:

- [x] 100x100 grid of square tiles

- [x] Predefined set of tiles in the “on” state 
    
    - Note: I did this randomly, maybe not the best choice. 

    - [x] In the wikipedia article, an “on” tile is black, an “off” tile is white

- [x] Start button

    - [x] This should start the simulation

    - [ ] Run an iteration every 500 milliseconds 

    - [x] Each iteration should be created based on the previous state

    - [x] Update the display for each iteration

- [x] Stop button

    - [ ] This should stop the simulation

    - [ ] The state should not change after pressing this button

### Stretch Goal 1:

- [ ] Allow user to click to toggle tile between “on” and “off” states

- [ ] [Bonus] Allow this interaction while simulation is playing

- [ ] Make the time between iterations configurable in milliseconds

### Stretch Goal 2:

- [ ] Increase grid size to 1000x1000

- [ ] Keep performance so we can update every 500ms

### Stretch Goal 3:

- [ ] Infinite grid size - do not predefine the size of the grid

- [ ] Optimize Algorithm to only act on tiles that are “on” and tiles that are adjacent to tiles that are “on”
